Q4: How would you implement a thread-safe lazy property?

That's a critical topic. The built-in lazy var is not thread-safe. If two threads try to access it at the same time before it's initialized, the initialization closure can run twice (a race condition), leading to wasted work and unpredictable state.

To implement a thread-safe lazy property, you must manually introduce synchronization. I have a few different "go-to" patterns for this, depending on the context.

1. The NSLock Approach (Classic & High-Performance)

This is a robust, fast, and common pattern. It uses a lock to protect the initialization block. The key is to check for the value inside the lock to ensure only one thread can ever perform the initialization.

```swift
class MyManager {
    
    // The private backing storage and the lock
    private var _cachedData: [String]?
    private let lock = NSLock()

    // The public computed property that acts as our "lazy" var
    var threadSafeData: [String] {
        // 1. Acquire the lock. Other threads will block here.
        lock.lock()
        
        // 2. Use 'defer' to guarantee the lock is released,
        //    even if the code crashes or returns.
        defer {
            lock.unlock()
        }

        // 3. We are now "in" the critical section.
        //    Check if the value has already been created.
        if let data = _cachedData {
            return data // It exists, return it.
        }

        // 4. It doesn't exist. This is the first thread in.
        //    Run the expensive operation.
        print("Initializing thread-safe data...")
        let data = (1...1000).map { "Item \($0)" }
        
        // 5. Cache the result
        _cachedData = data
        
        // 6. Return the new data
        return data
    }
}
```

Trade-offs:

Pro: Very fast and efficient. NSLock is a lightweight primitive.

Con: It's verbose. You have to write all this boilerplate for every lazy property.

Con: Every single access (even after initialization) has to pay the small cost of acquiring and releasing the lock.


2. The Actor Approach (Modern & Safest)

If the class or struct is part of a modern Swift Concurrency (async/await) codebase, the best solution is to not make the property thread-safe, but to make the entire object that holds it thread-safe.

We do this by declaring the class as an actor.

```swift
actor DataCache {
    
    // Inside an actor, 'lazy var' *is* thread-safe!
    // The actor serializes all access, so a race condition
    // on initialization is impossible.
    lazy var complexData: [String] = {
        print("Initializing thread-safe data inside actor...")
        return (1...1000).map { "Item \($0)" }
    }()

    // Accessing the data must be done in an 'async' context
    func getData() -> [String] {
        // The 'await' is implicit because we are inside the actor,
        // but 'complexData' is accessed safely.
        return self.complexData
    }
}

// How it would be used from the outside:
let cache = DataCache()
Task {
    let data = await cache.getData() // The caller must 'await'
    print(data.count)
}
```

Trade-offs:

Pro: By far the cleanest, safest, and most idiomatic way in modern Swift. The compiler enforces the safety.

Pro: No manual locking or boilerplate.

Con: It requires the rest of your code to interact with this object using async/await, which might be a large change if the project doesn't already use it.


3. The Reusable Generic Wrapper (My Preferred "Senior" Solution)

For non-actor classes, the NSLock boilerplate is annoying. A better way is to abstract that logic into its own reusable class or struct. I'd build a small, generic "box" to handle this.

```swift
/// A generic class that provides thread-safe, lazy initialization
/// of a value.
final class ThreadSafeLazy<T> {
    
    private var factory: (() -> T)?
    private var value: T?
    private let lock = NSLock()

    init(factory: @escaping () -> T) {
        self.factory = factory
    }

    /// The lazily-initialized value.
    /// Accessing this property will trigger the factory on first use.
    var wrappedValue: T {
        lock.lock()
        defer { lock.unlock() }

        // 1. Check if we've already cached a value
        if let value = self.value {
            return value
        }
        
        // 2. We haven't. Run the factory.
        // We can safely unwrap 'factory' because it's only set to nil
        // inside this same critical section.
        let newValue = self.factory!()
        
        // 3. Cache the new value
        self.value = newValue
        
        // 4. (Optional but good) Release the closure
        //    to free any resources it might be holding.
        self.factory = nil
        
        return newValue
    }
}
```

How to use it: This makes my calling code much cleaner.

```swift
class MyViewModel {
    
    // Instead of 'lazy var', I just declare this.
    // It's not a 'var' so it's even safer.
    let complexData = ThreadSafeLazy {
        print("Initializing data via wrapper...")
        return (1...1000).map { "Item \($0)" }
    }
    
    func loadData() {
        // Just access '.wrappedValue'
        // The first access will print "Initializing..."
        let data = complexData.wrappedValue
        
        // This second access will be fast and won't print.
        let dataAgain = complexData.wrappedValue
    }
}
```

My Recommendation
If I'm in a modern async/await codebase, I will always use an actor. It's the cleanest and most correct solution.

If I'm in a more traditional UIKit/GCD codebase, I will use the ThreadSafeLazy generic wrapper. I've probably already built it as part of our team's core utilities. It provides all the safety of manual locking without any of the repetitive boilerplate.
