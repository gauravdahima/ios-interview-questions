Q8: What are access modifiers in swift?

Access modifiers (or access control) are keywords in Swift that define the visibility of your types (like classes, structs, and enums) and their members (properties, methods, initializers).

Their primary purpose is encapsulation. They allow you to hide the internal, complex implementation details of your code and expose only a clean, intentional, and safe public interface. This is crucial for writing maintainable, scalable, and secure code, especially when building frameworks or working on a team.

Swift provides five distinct access levels. I'll list them from the most open (least restrictive) to the least open (most restrictive).

1. Open

What it is: The most permissive access level.

Visibility: Entities are accessible from any source file in the defining module and any module that imports it.

Key Feature: This is the only level that allows code outside the module to subclass the class or override the method.

When to use it: This is explicitly for framework authors. If you are building a library and you want the developers using your library to be able to subclass your CustomButton class, you must mark the class and its overridable methods as open.


2. public

What it is: The second most permissive level, and a common point of confusion with open.

Visibility: Entities are accessible from any source file in the defining module and any module that imports it (just like open).

The Critical Difference: Code outside the module CANNOT subclass a public class or override a public method.

When to use it: This is the standard for framework authors. When you want to expose a class or method as part of your framework's stable API, but you do not want consumers to subclass or change its behavior, you make it public. Think of it as a "read-only" or "final" API for external modules.


3. internal (The Default)

What it is: The default access level. If you don't write any modifier, your code is internal.

Visibility: Entities are accessible from any source file within their own module, but not from any source file outside that module.

When to use it: This is what you use for 95% of your code within an application. All the view models, services, and helper classes that your app needs to function—but that no external framework needs to see—are internal by default. It's the "team-level" access.


4. fileprivate

What it is: A very specific access level.

Visibility: Entities are accessible only from within the single file where they are defined.

When to use it: This is for "helper" code. Imagine you have a complex UIViewController and you write a small struct or a helper extension that is only used by that one view controller and has no business being seen by any other file in your module. You mark it fileprivate to make that clear.


5. private

What it is: The most restrictive access level.

Visibility: Entities are accessible only from within their enclosing declaration (e.g., the class, struct, or enum) and any extension of that type in the same file.

The "Same File Extension" Rule: This is a crucial senior-level detail. In older versions of Swift, private was so restrictive that even an extension in the same file couldn't see the type's private properties. This made it hard to organize code. Now, private is much more useful.

When to use it: This should be your default starting point for properties and methods. My guiding principle is "start private". I make a property or method private first. Only if I find I need to access it from another type (even in the same file) do I "promote" it to fileprivate or internal.


Summary of Principles

Principle of Least Privilege: Always use the most restrictive access level possible and only "promote" it when necessary. Start private.

Module vs. App: For a framework, the open/public/internal distinction is critical. For a single-target app, the main distinction is between internal, fileprivate, and private.

open vs. public: The only difference is subclassing and overriding from another module.
