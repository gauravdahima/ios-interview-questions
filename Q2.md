Q2: ARC in classes (references type) vs structs (value types)?

ARC, weak, and unowned do not apply to value types like structs and enums.

These mechanisms exclusively manage the lifetime of reference types (classes).

1. The Fundamental Difference: Copy vs. Reference
The entire reason ARC exists is to manage shared ownership of a single instance of data in memory. This is what classes do.

Value types (struct) don't have shared ownership. They are always copied.

When you assign a struct to a new variable or pass it to a function, you are creating a new, independent copy of that struct and all its data.

Code Example (Struct - Value Type):

```swift
struct Point {
    var x: Int
}

var p1 = Point(x: 10)
var p2 = p1 // p2 is a *new copy* of p1.

// Mutating p2 does *not* affect p1
p2.x = 20

print(p1.x) // Output: 10
print(p2.x) // Output: 20
```

Since p1 and p2 are two independent copies, there is no shared instance to manage. When p1 or p2 goes out of scope (e.g., the function ends), its memory is simply and immediately reclaimed from the stack. There's no need for a reference count.


Code Example (Class - Reference Type):

```swift
class CPoint {
    var x: Int
    init(x: Int) { self.x = x }
}

var c1 = CPoint(x: 10)
var c2 = c1 // c2 is a *reference* to the *same instance* as c1.
           // ARC count for this CPoint is now 2.

// Mutating c2 *does* affect c1, because they point to the same object
c2.x = 20

print(c1.x) // Output: 20
print(c2.x) // Output: 20
```

Because c1 and c2 share the same object, ARC is required to know when that object is no longer needed (i.e., when both c1 and c2 are gone).

2. Why weak and unowned Are Impossible for Structs

Since structs are copied, they cannot create a reference cycle.

A reference cycle (or retain cycle) is what weak and unowned are designed to break. A cycle can only happen when two class instances hold strong references to each other.

You cannot have a struct instance hold a reference to another struct instance in a way that creates a cycle, because the "reference" would just be a copy.

For this reason, the Swift compiler will throw an error if you even try:

```swift
struct MyStruct {
    // This will not compile:
    // error: 'weak' may only be applied to class and class-bound protocol types
    weak var other: MyStruct?
}
```

The compiler itself enforces this, because the concept of a weak value type doesn't make sense.

3. The Important Nuance: Structs Containing Classes

This is the senior-level "gotcha" that you must be aware of.

What happens if a struct contains a reference type (a class) as one of its properties?

```swift
class User {
    var username: String
    init(username: String) { self.username = username }
}

struct Post {
    var title: String
    var author: User // 'author' is a class (reference type)
}

let john = User(username: "john_doe") // john: count = 1

var post1 = Post(title: "Hello", author: john)
// john: count = 2 (held by 'john' and 'post1.author')
```

Now, what happens when we copy the struct?

```swift
var post2 = post1
// john: count = 3 (held by 'john', 'post1.author', and 'post2.author')
```

When we copied post1 to create post2, the struct itself was copied (the title was copied). But the author property, being a reference, was also copied. This means both post1 and post2 now hold strong references to the exact same User instance.

If you modify the User object through post1, you will see the change through post2:

```swift
post1.author.username = "john_smith"
print(post2.author.username) // Output: "john_smith"
```

How this relates to ARC:

The structs (post1, post2) are still not managed by ARC.
The User instance (john) is managed by ARC.
The structs participate in ARC by holding strong references to the User instance.
When post1 and post2 go out of scope, their strong references to john are broken, his count decrements, and if it hits zero, he is deallocated.

So, while a struct itself can't be in a retain cycle, it can act as a bridge for a strong reference that is part of a cycle.

Example: If post1.author (which is john) had a closure that captured a class that owned post1, you could create a cycle. The struct is the "link" in that chain.


In summary:

Structs: Value types, always copied, not managed by ARC.
Classes: Reference types, shared, managed by ARC.
weak/unowned: Tools to break strong reference cycles between classes.
The Pitfall: Be mindful when structs contain class properties, as those references are managed by ARC and are copied as references, not as deep copies of the object.

This behavior is fundamental to Swift's performance and safety model, encouraging the use of structs for data and classes for state and identity.
